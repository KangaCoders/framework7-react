# Framework7 React

**UPDATE**: Work is in progress on [this branch](https://github.com/bencompton/Framework7-react/tree/f7-router) to create an automated process for converting components from [Framework7 Vue](https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7-Vue) into React components. Vue 2.0 and React work very similarly, and this automated approach has been working out very well. This means that as new components and bugfixes are added to Framework7 Vue over time, React users will be able to enjoy all of the same goodness.

Keep an eye on the [kitchen sink](https://bencompton.github.io/framework7-react/reactify-vue/) over the coming weeks as new pages are added and bugs are squashed. Once the kitchen sink is complete and the components are all stable, this new version will be merged to master and published to NPM. At that point, everything currently available in Framework7 Vue should be in Framework7 React as well.

Also in development is [Framework7 Redux](https://github.com/bencompton/framework7-redux).
